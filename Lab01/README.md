### Program 1 : integer_representation.c :

It has option of displaying 32 bit as well as 64 bit integer representation. The variable `int bits` decides the number of bits to be displayed . Type in 64 or 32(default) for such representation.

<br/>

### Program 2 : float_representation.c :

The program represents the IEEE format of saving floating point number. The program consists of a union data structure storing a floating point number which in turn is divided into sign bit, mantissa, and exponent. The size of exponent, mantissa controls the representation of floating point number by printing the binary equivalent of mantissa and exponent of the floating point number.

<br/>

### Program 3 : double_representation.c :

Same as float_representation. Difference lies in the bit size of exponent and mantissa. (11 and 52 respectively)
